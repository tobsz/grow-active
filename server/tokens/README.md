Here should be a file `tokens.json` containing all tokens necessary for accessing the Fitbit Web API endpoints. 
The file should look as follows:
```javascript
{
    "client_id": "<cliend_id>",
    "client_secret": "<cliend_secret>",
    "access_token": "<access_token>",
    "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>",
}
```
